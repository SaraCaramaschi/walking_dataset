Abstract; 
We are publishing a walking activity dataset including inertial and positioning information from 18 volunteers including reference distance measured using a trundle wheel. The dataset includes a total of 96.7 Km walked by the volunteers, split into 203 separate tracks. The trundle wheel is of two types: it is either an analogue trundle wheel which provides the total amount of meters walked in a single track, or it is a sensorized trundle wheel which measures every revolution of the wheel, therefore recording a continuous incremental distance.  

Each track has data from the accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in the phones, location information from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and the step count obtained by the device. The dataset can be used to implement walking distance estimation algorithms and to explore data quality in the context of walking activity and physical capacity tests, fitness, and pedestrian navigation.
